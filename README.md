# PulseTrack 🌐🩺

**PulseTrack** is the interactive web interface for **PulseX** — an AI-powered intelligent stethoscope designed to bring accessible cardiovascular health monitoring to users everywhere.

PulseTrack allows users to input demographic data, launch heartbeat recording, view educational content, and track the evolution of the PulseX project — all through a clean, user-friendly UI.

## 🎉 Project Status

✅ Currently **static** HTML/CSS/JS interface.  
🚀 Future plan: Python backend server will connect the interface to Raspberry Pi — to send user data and receive real-time predictions from the AI model.

## 🚀 Usage

### Current usage (Static)

You can simply open the `index.html` (Home) page in any modern browser — no server required for now.

### Planned dynamic usage (Future)

- A Python server will be developed to:
  - Connect Raspberry Pi to the web interface
  - Receive demographic data from UI
  - Trigger recording of heartbeat sounds on Pi
  - Send AI model predictions back to UI (normal / abnormal)

---

## 🎓 Educational Mission

PulseTrack also serves as a tool for:

- Raising awareness of cardiovascular health
- Teaching users about heart anatomy, sounds, and common conditions
- Encouraging healthy habits for heart care

(LearnHub makes this mission fun and engaging!)
